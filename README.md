# Decentralized Stablecoin (DSC) Project  

## Overview  
This project is a decentralized stablecoin (DSC) built on the Ethereum blockchain using Solidity. The stablecoin aims to maintain a stable value through algorithmic mechanisms, leveraging smart contracts to ensure trust, transparency, and decentralization.  

## Features  
- **Minting and Burning**: Users can mint new stablecoins by collateralizing assets or burn them to retrieve their collateral.  
- **Price Stability**: Algorithmic mechanisms maintain the peg to the target asset (e.g., USD).  
- **Security**: Built with best practices in Solidity development to ensure safety and reliability.  

## Technologies Used  
- **Smart Contracts**: Developed using Solidity.  
- **Blockchain Platform**: Ethereum.  
- **Testing Framework**: Foundary for testing and deployment.  
- **Tools**: OpenZeppelin for contract security and standards.
